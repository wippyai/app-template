# Wippy Frontend Development Guide

## Architecture

Wippy uses a **host-based architecture**. The web host application provides:
- Chat with AI agents
- Page display and navigation
- Theme and CSS injection into child content
- WebSocket relay for real-time features
- Host-mediated state persistence for child content (survives iframe reloads)

Child content runs inside the host in two forms:

### Web Apps
Full Vue 3 applications loaded in sandboxed **iframes**. They control a full viewport with routing, layout, and navigation. The host injects CSS (fonts, theme, PrimeVue) and provides a proxy API via `window.$W`.

### Web Components
Custom elements loaded as **ES modules** directly in the host page. They use Shadow DOM for style encapsulation and import the proxy API from `@wippy-fe/proxy`. The host provides shared dependencies (Vue, Pinia) via import maps.

### Proxy API

Both web apps and web components communicate with the host through the **Wippy Proxy API** — the same capabilities, different access patterns:

| | Web Apps (iframe) | Web Components |
|---|---|---|
| **API access** | `const api = await window.$W.api()` | `import { api } from '@wippy-fe/proxy'` |
| **Host actions** | `const host = await window.$W.host()` | `import { host } from '@wippy-fe/proxy'` |
| **Events** | `const on = (await window.$W.instance()).on` | `import { on } from '@wippy-fe/proxy'` |
| **CSS injection** | Automatic via proxy config | Declarative via `hostCssKeys` |
| **Build externals** | `vue`, `pinia`, `vue-router`, `@iconify/vue`, `@wippy-fe/proxy`, `axios`, `primevue/*` | `vue`, `pinia`, `@iconify/vue`, `@wippy-fe/proxy` |

For the full host architecture (communication flow, PostMessage protocol, theme inheritance, AppConfig), see the [gen-2-chat README](https://github.com/nichochar/gen-2-chat) — specifically the "Wippy Host Architecture" and "Style Inheritance & Theming" sections.

Full proxy API type definitions ship with the `@wippy-fe/proxy` npm package at `node_modules/@wippy-fe/proxy/index.d.ts`.

### Reading Order

1. **This file** — understand the architecture
2. **component-guide.md** or **app-guide.md** — depending on what you're building
3. **best-practices.md** — general Vue/Tailwind conventions
4. **proxy-api.md** — when you need API details
5. **host-spec.md** — when you need to understand the host contract
